# AwesomeChatBot

AwesomeChatBot is a chat bot framework that can work with any chat program.
It is built on .net core, and thus OS independent.

**Extensebility**<br />
The framework was built with extensibility in mind. Pretty much any part from this framework can be overriden and tailored to the personal needs. <br />
____________________________________

The set of classes / modules this framework provides by default, will give you a good start and should allow you to implement the common use cases.

**Moduls**<br />
This framework uses moduls to allow you to define, how your chat commands will be handled, how the bot reacts to them, basically how the user interacts with the bot.

## Getting started
For starters and a quick reference, check my own bot https://github.com/RononDex/Astrobot on how the framework is implemented, it's pretty straight forward!

The most important parts are
 - ApiWrappers
 - CommandHandlers
 - Commands
